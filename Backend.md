#  Software Engineer (Backend) Challenge

## Background

Here in SETUP TECH, we are developing a platform for real-time data update to end users. As a software engineer in SETUP TECH, you have to provide a reliable backend system and complete web application to clients. Your task here is to develop a web application so as to end users can chat directly in real-time and to implement three endpoints for Custom Mobile App to login the system, to send a message and load/get old message list for a target user.

## Technical Requirement

1. We value a clean, simple working solution.

2. You must provide a `setup.sh` bash script at the root of the project, which should setup all relevant applications. It must work on Linux, MacOS.

3. We prefer the following language/platform: `PHP`, `Node.js`.

4. A Database must be used (at SETUP TECH we use mostly MySQL) but PostgreSQL is strongly requested for the challenge. The DB installation & initialisation must be done in `setup.sh`.

5. You must submit the project as a git repository (github.com, bitbucket.com, gitlab.com). Repository must avoid containing words `setuptech`, `setuptechchallenge` and `challenge` if it's a public repo.

6. Having unit/integration tests is a strong bonus.

7. Your code should be modular, each module should focus on doing one thing and do it well.

8. The solution must be production ready.

9. Ignore over-engineering.


## User Requirement

###  Web Application 

1. User friendly Interface will be bonus

2. Simple Sign up and login system

3. End user will see the active users who are using the system right now

4. They can send/receive message in real-time

5. Synchronisation with Mobile Application Backend system. 

### API Endpoints

1. It'll be a RESTful HTTP API listening to port 8080

2. The API must implement 3 endpoints with path, method, request and response body as specified
  
   - One endpoint to login (see sample)
      * To login, the API client must provide his info
      * The API response is an object containing the active users in system right now
 
   - One endpoint to send a text message (see sample)

     * API responds with a success message

   - One endpoint to list/load all message (see sample)

3. All responses should be in json format no matter in success or failure situations.
